I have identified that the test failures are due to missing package dependencies (`haven`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `labelled`) that are used in the translation functions but not listed in the `Depends` field of the `DESCRIPTION` file. Adding these packages to `Depends` will ensure they are available when the package and its tests are run.
