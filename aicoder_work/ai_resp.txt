The primary issue causing the test failures is that the `labelled` package, which is used by `t_decode` and `t_encode` (and loaded in `aic_do_test.R`), is not declared as a dependency in the `DESCRIPTION` file. Adding `labelled` to the `Depends` field will ensure it's available during package checks and usage.
