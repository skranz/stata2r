I have analyzed the failing `do2` test. The primary issue appears to be a row order mismatch after a `sort` command, specifically affecting the `id` column, which is generated using `_n` (row number). This suggests a subtle difference in how R and Stata handle sorting, particularly regarding tie-breaking when numeric values might have minute floating-point discrepancies.

Stata's `sort` is stable, and `dplyr::arrange` is also generally stable. To ensure consistent tie-breaking, `stata2r_original_order_idx` is introduced and used as the final tie-breaker in `t_sort` and temporary `t_egen` sorts.

The most probable cause is that floating-point arithmetic differences in prior `generate`/`replace` commands lead to `value1` having slightly different values in R compared to Stata. While these differences might be too small to be flagged by `compare_df` with its default `tol` or `digits = 7` rounding, they could still cause a different sort order in the underlying data.

To address this, I will increase the precision of rounding in `sfun_strip_stata_attributes` during dataframe comparison. This will make the comparison more stringent, revealing if `value1` (or other numeric columns) itself has discrepancies that are causing the sort order to diverge. If the issue persists with `id` being the only difference, it would suggest a deeper, inherent difference in sorting stability behavior that is not resolvable by simply adding a numeric index.

I will modify `sfun_strip_stata_attributes` to round numeric values to 10 decimal digits for comparison.
