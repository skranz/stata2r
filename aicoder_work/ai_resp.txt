The current test failures indicate that some required packages (`labelled`, `haven`, `tidyr`, `readr`) are not being loaded, even though `library()` calls are present in the test script. This suggests that these packages are not declared as dependencies in the `DESCRIPTION` file. Adding them to the `Depends` field will ensure they are available when the package is used or tested. No other code changes are immediately necessary based on the provided error logs.
